### Store customized versions of APK lists to suite your functionality needs

### When ready just copy a file from here to replace the standard list files in '/lists/ directory. 
```
- Example: copy file from /lists/custom-lists/custom-android.txt to /lists/custom.txt
- Then run the debloat or restore menu option "Custom". This will then read from your custom list!
